Project Overview
Welcome to the documentation for the Rothko-Style Art Project!
 In this project, we explore the CSS Box Model to create rectangular art pieces inspired by the style of artist Mark Rothko. 
 Each HTML element is treated as an individual box, allowing us to control spacing, borders, and visual effects using the Box Model principles.

Project Features

Canvas and Frame:
The project includes a canvas div within a frame, simulating the space for Rothko-style art.

Rectangular Art Pieces:
Three div elements named "one," "two," and "three" represent individual art pieces with unique styles.

CSS Box Model:
Utilizes width, height, margin, padding, and border properties to control the layout and appearance of each box.

Color and Styling:
Different background colors and box-shadow effects are applied to create visual interest and mimic Rothko's style.

Transformations:
Uses the transform property to rotate and position the art pieces for a dynamic and artistic effect.

Filter and Blur:
Applies the filter property to add blur effects, enhancing the artistic appeal of the project.
