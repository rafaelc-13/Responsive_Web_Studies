Project Overview
The "Cafe Menu" project is a beginner-friendly HTML and CSS study exercise, where you build a simple webpage for a cafe menu. The project aims to teach and reinforce the use of HTML tags and CSS styling to structure and design a webpage.

Learning Achievements
This project covers the following studies and concepts:

  Basic HTML structure (DOCTYPE, head, body)
  HTML tags (h1, h2, p, section, article, img, hr, a)
  CSS styling (background, font-family, padding, margin, max-width)
  Class and ID usage for styling specific elements
  Responsive design using media queries (viewport meta tag)
  Linking external stylesheets
  Image elements and alt attributes for accessibility

HTML Structure
The HTML structure is divided into sections, each representing a category in the cafe menu. Here's a breakdown:

Head Section:
<meta> tags for character set and viewport settings.
<title> for the webpage title.
Link to an external stylesheet (styles.css).

Body Section:
<div class="menu">: Container for the entire menu.
<h1>: Main heading for the cafe.
<p class="established">: Paragraph for the establishment date.
<section>: Coffee section with a heading, image, and articles.
<section>: Desserts section with a heading, image, and articles.
<hr class="bottom-line">: Horizontal line for separation.
<footer>: Footer with a link and address.

CSS Styling
The CSS file (styles.css) provides styling for the entire webpage. Key styling features include:

Background:
Body background with a coffee beans image.

Fonts:
Sans-serif font for the body.
Impact or serif font for <h1> and <h2>.

Layout:
Container (menu) with a maximum width of 500px, centered, and with padding.
Images centered within their containers.
