Project Documentation: Accessibility Quiz
Project Overview:

    Accessibility is the key focus of this project. The goal is to create an accessible quiz webpage, incorporating keyboard shortcuts, ARIA attributes, and design best practices.

Design Choices:

    HTML Structure:
    Sections are used to divide content logically.
    role and aria-labelledby attributes are applied for accessibility.
    A form is created with sections for student information, HTML questions, and CSS questions.
    Descriptive labels and alt attributes for images ensure accessibility.

    CSS Styling:
    Responsive design using media queries for smooth scrolling.
    Clear styling for headers, navigation, forms, and footer.
    Use of relative units (vw, em) for better responsiveness.

    CSS Classes and Ids:
    Classes and ids are used to style specific elements and improve maintainability.
    The .sr-only class is added for visually hidden elements used for screen readers.

Accessibility Considerations:

    Semantic HTML:
    Proper use of semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, form, etc.).
    Labels, legends, and ARIA attributes enhance screen reader support.
    ARIA roles and attributes are used for accessibility. The role attribute is added to sections, and aria-labelledby is used for better screen reader support.

    Keyboard Navigation:
    Accessible navigation with keyboard shortcuts (accesskey attribute).
    Ensured tabindex for focusable elements.

    Readable Text:
    Sufficient color contrast for text readability.
    Use of appropriate font size and family for improved legibility.

Comments:
    Comments have been added to the code to explain specific sections and design choices.
    Clarifications on why certain elements and attributes were chosen for better connectivity and accessibility.

Accessibility Considerations:
Accesskeys are provided for quick navigation, considering users who may rely on keyboard shortcuts.
Labels and descriptions are added for form elements to improve accessibility.
