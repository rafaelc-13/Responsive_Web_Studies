Project Documentation: CatPhotoApp

Introduction:

SHTML tags provide structure to webpages, allowing the addition of elements like photos and buttons. 
This project focuses on learning common HTML tags by creating a cat photo app. 
Through this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with HTML tags, creating a webpage that features cat photos, lists, and a form.

Small Improvements:

1. Comments: Consider adding comments to explain specific sections of your code. This can help others understand your thought process.

2.  Alt Text:  Ensure meaningful `alt` attributes for images. It improves accessibility and search engine optimization.

Analysis of Code
Studies and Learnings:


1.  HTML Structure: 
   - You've used the standard HTML5 doctype and created the basic structure of an HTML document with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.

2.  Head Section: 
   - The `<title>` tag in the `<head>` section sets the title of the webpage.

3.  Main Section: 
   - The `<main>` tag is used to contain the main content of the page, providing a semantic structure.

4.  Headings: 
   - Proper use of heading tags `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>` for structuring content hierarchically.

5.  Links: 
   - Usage of `<a>` tags for creating links with appropriate attributes, including target="_blank" for opening links in a new tab.

6.  Images: 
   - Embedding images using `<img>` tags with `alt` attributes for accessibility.

7.  Lists: 
   - Creating lists using `<ul>` and `<ol>` tags, emphasizing semantic meaning.

8.  Form: 
   - Constructing a form using the `<form>` tag with various input types (radio buttons, checkboxes, and text input).

9.  Fieldsets and Legends: 
   - Proper use of `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` tags for grouping and labeling form elements.

     Documentation:

1.  Cat Photos Section: 
   - Displays a cat photo with a link to an external cat photo gallery.

2.  Cat Lists Section: 
   - Lists things cats love and hate with corresponding images.

3.  Cat Form Section: 
   - A form to submit cat photos, featuring radio buttons, checkboxes, and a text input field.

4.  Footer: 
   - Includes a footer with a copyright statement and a link to freeCodeCamp.org.

     Conclusion:

This project showcases your understanding of fundamental HTML concepts, including document structure, headings, links, images, lists, and forms. 
  The code is well-organized, making it beginner-friendly and easy to follow. 
    Ensure you continue practicing and exploring more advanced HTML features as you progress in your coding journey.
